# TIC_TAC_TOE_Console
The project was made for fun, I applied here my improved coding style =). As usual feel free to use the code. I'll be happy if somebody learn from the project. 

To use the program, copy all three .py files to one folder and then start main.py

If you have any questions send me email kozirev8@gmail.com.
